        <center><h2>HOBBIES</h2></center>
        <p><center>My most prevalent hobby during higschool was the piano, through playing it, many gathered to
            watch and listen leading to me becoming friends with quite a few, this lead to me having an
            easier time completing work due to the help I was able to receive from them, as well as 
            just an overall more enjoyable highschool experience.

        <center><h2>FAVOURITE QUOTE</h2></center>
        <p><center>While you are alive, you need a reason for your existence. Being unable to find one is the same as being 
            dead - Naruto</center>

        <h3><center>Why I chose this quote/person</center></h3>
            <p><center>I chose Naruto because he is a hardworking individual and throughout the series he has not
                stopped pushing and maintained his clear and only goal of becoming Hokage regardless of what hardships
                he faces.
