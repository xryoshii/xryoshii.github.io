        <center><h2>Applying "Twelve Pillars"</h2></center>
        <p><center>Incorporating the concepts outlined in chapters 4, to 7 of "Twelve Pillars" into my life entails
            developing discipline by following organized routines and setting goals. It also involves working
            by striving for self improvement and staying resilient. Additionally it means having a vision,
            for my life that influences my decision making process well as integrating my passions into both
            my daily activities and long term objectives. This approach helps me stay motivated and equips me 
            with the ability to overcome challenges ultimately leading to a prosperous life.
